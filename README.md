# Overview
My personal educational notes written in [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). Since GitHub has MarkDown Rendering built into it, I have decided to port a copy over so people can use them.

# Discliamer
While I've attempted to ensure the information is accurate, I cannot guarantee that it is.

If you spot something incorrect, please contact me or submit a merge request.

Currently, there are a large number of formatting errors due to transitioning from Joplin over to GitHub. 
If you clone the repo and and render them using a markdown software with LaTex or KaTex support this should resolve these issues.

# TO-DO
I plan to address this rendering issue as soon as I get time to do so (most likely by writing the notes up in LaTex instead of markdown).
